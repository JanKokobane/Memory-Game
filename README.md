# Memory Card Game

## Objective
The goal of the game is to find all matching pairs of cards by using your memory and observation skills.

## Setup
1. The game board consists of 16 cards arranged in a 4x4 grid.
2. Each card has a front side and a back side. The back side displays a unique letter (A-H), which forms a pair with another card.
3. At the start of the game, all cards are placed face down.

## How to Play
1. Click on any two cards to flip them over and reveal the letters on their back sides.
2. If the letters on the two flipped cards match, the cards will remain face up, indicating a successful match.
3. If the letters do not match, the cards will flip back over to their face-down position after a brief delay (1 second).
4. Continue flipping pairs of cards until all matching pairs have been found.

## Rules
1. Only two cards can be flipped at a time.
2. If the two flipped cards do not match, they will automatically flip back over after 1 second.
3. The game ends when all pairs are successfully matched.

## Tips
- Remember the positions and letters of previously flipped cards to find matches more efficiently.
- Start by flipping over different pairs to gather information about the card positions.

## Winning the Game
You win the game when you successfully match all 8 pairs of cards, leaving all cards face up on the game board.
